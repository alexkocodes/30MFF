# 30MFF - "Day in the life of an NYU student..."

# Project Description
This is the website for the premiere of the short film: "Day in the life of an NYU student..." by Alex Ko and Ngoc Hoang. The user will go over a series of headlines that prompt user to keep scrolling until we finally get a glimpse of how it is like to be an NYU student living in the Big Apple. This project draws on the significant features of NYU, such as the purple color and Bobcat, for the purpose of serving an immersive viewing experience. It not only focuses on visuals, but also on the sounds and interactivty of the website. Scroll down the page to feel that little jump of different sections. Click on Bobcat to hear his aggressive meow. Or simply hit that submit button to give us some love, which we will show in return when you click on the web page. NYU has its dynasty across the globe, and we hope to further spread the purple spirit to every edge of the world with our lovely film. 

# Process
1. I first started by creating the simple outline of all the divs and tags. 
2. Later I moved on to make sure all the javascript code works as desired, but just roughly. 
3. I worked on the CSS on each page, then revisit the javascript code to adjust accordingly. 
4. Further polish the CSS to make sure all the colors, fonts, animation duration, transition, etc work as desired. 

# Reflection/Evaluation
Honestly, what I have accomplished exceeds my initial expectations. My inital plan was to keep things simple and bold, but as I progressed, new ideas came up and I was just playing with my creativity. I also took inspiration from a lot of online resources, especially from codepen, but I challenged myself to modify the code and build beautiful CSS animations by myself. This project enabled me to design a platform that provides an immersive storytelling experience with my own coding skills, and I truly learned a lot about how software art can be transformative in modern art because of its flexibility and accessibility.
